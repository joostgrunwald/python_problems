Lets say we are hired by a brick company that sells bricks to people.
The brick company has a single factory that makes certain kind of bricks.
https://capricebaksteen.nl
Now lets say for a given month, an x amount of bricks are produced every week.
The brick factory wants to be able to see how many bricks of a certain type are in stock.
They also want to see how many they are still expected to produce.
In addition to this they want to have a model that shows possible problems with in and output.
During the course of a few lessons we are going to help this brick company achieve this.
We will start each lesson with a bit of theory, and then follow by solving the problems one by one. 

Today we are first going to use functions, loops and global variables in order to manage stock.
Exercise 1a: create some variable to save the amount of stock for the following bricks: "DCR, DCER, WSEMA-B"
Exercise 1b: the first week the amount of produces bricks for WSEMA-B was 1234, the second week 987, the third week 1204, save these in a list.
